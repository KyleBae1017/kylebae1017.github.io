I am a M.S. student at <a href="https://mlv.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST MLV Lab</a> (School of Computing), advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LfBoJt8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Hyunwoo J. Kim</a>. Previously, I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering and Mathematics from <a href="https://www.korea.edu/"> Korea University</a> in 2025. For more details, please see my <a href="https://kylebae1017.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_MinseongBae.pdf">CV</a>.

My research interests lie in machine learning, with a particular focus on **geometric deep learning**, **diffusion/flow-based generative models**, and **multimodal learning**. Currently, I'm focusing on **RL-based post-training** methods for generative models.

Beyond theory, I am deeply interested in applying machine learning to natural sciences to tackle impactful real-world problems (**AI4Science**). In this context, I have been working on multimodal language models, diffusion-based generative models and agentic systems for **biomolecules** and **weather patterns**.

My long-term research goal is to develop robust, scalable learning methods that enable self-evolving, human-collaborative agents for scientific discovery.
