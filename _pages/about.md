I am a M.S. student at <a href="https://mlv.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST MLV Lab</a> in School of Computing advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LfBoJt8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Hyunwoo J. Kim</a>. Prior to studying at KAIST, I earned my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering / Mathematics at <a href="https://www.korea.edu/"> Korea University</a> in 2025. For more information, please check my CV.

My research interests span machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on **geometric deep learning**, **diffusion/flow-based generative models**, and **multimodal learning**. Nowadays, I’m mainly interested in **RL-based post-training** methods for generative models.

I’m also very interested in applying machine learning to natural sciences and tackling impactful real-world problems (**AI4Science**). So, I have been working on multimodal language models, diffusion-based generative models and agentic systems for **biomolecules** and **weather patterns**.

My long-term research goal is to develop robust and scalable learning methods that enable a self-evolving human-collaborative agent for scientific discovery.

Feel free to reach out to me via contact email if you’d like to discuss anything related to me!
